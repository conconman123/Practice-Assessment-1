        <li>Robert Downey Jr. kept food hidden all over the lab set, and apparently nobody could find where it was, so they just let him continue doing it. In the movie, that's his actual food he's offering, and when he was eating, it wasn't scripted, he was just hungry.</li>
        <li>The Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures logos are seen within the Tesseract.</li>
        <li>There were very few times that everyone was in town at once, but on one night when they were, Chris Evans sent them all a text message reading "Assemble" (the tagline to the movie), prompting a night out on the town. Clark Gregg has stated that this is his favorite text message that he has ever received.</li>
